    <h1>Portal Walk</h1>
    <p>
        Bob magically got teleported into a 1-dimensional world full of portals
        and needs your help to escape!
    </p>
    <p>
        Bob is currently at position $0$,
        and needs to reach the portal at position $X$ to return to his 3-dimensional world. 
        In between Bob and the exit are $N$ pairs of portals.
    </p>
    <p>
        The portals exist in pairs.
        If Bob walks into a portal,
        he will be instantly teleported to the other portal in the pair.
        In this 1-dimensional world, Bob can <b>only</b> walk forwards
        and moves exactly one position forward with each step. 
        Teleporting between portals does not count as a step. 
        Bob needs to know the number of steps it will take him to
        reach the exit so he can mentally prepare for the journey ahead. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Can you help him?
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line contains two integers $N$ and $X$, the number of pairs of portals and the position of the exit.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next $N$ lines each contain two integers, $a_i$ and $b_i$, the locations of the ith pair of portals. <br>

        It is guaranteed that no two portals are in the same location.
    </p>
    <p>
        $1 \leq N \leq 1000$ <br>
        $1 \leq X \leq 1e5$ <br>
        $1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq X <br>
        All inputs are integers.
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        The number of steps it will take Bob to reach the exit.

<p>
    Bob starts at position 0. <br>
    After 3 steps, Bob gets teleported from position 3 to position 11 (portal pair 1). <br>
    After 7 steps, Bob gets teleported from position 15 to position 5 (portal pair 2). <br>
    After 13 steps, Bob gets teleported from position 11 to position 3 (portal pair 1). <br>
    After 15 steps, Bob gets teleported from position 5 to position 15 (portal pair 2). <br>
    After 16 steps, Bob gets teleported from position 16 to position 19 (portal pair 3). <br>
    After 17 steps, Bob reaches the exit at position 20. <br>
