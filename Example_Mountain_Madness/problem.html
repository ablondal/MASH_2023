    <h1>Mountain Madness</h1>
    <p>
        Bob <b>loves</b> golfing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Specifically, he loves minigolfing.
        Recently, he had a dream idea for a minigolf hole!
        He wants to make a hole at the top of an alphabet mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
        He's asked you to make this mountain and hole for him.
        But in true minigolf fashion, he's asked that your code to do so is as small
        as possible.
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The input will consist of a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 27$), the size of the mountain.
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        Output the mountain, hole, and flag, as in the samples.
        Please be careful with whitespace, as the solution is sensitive to whitespace
        used.

<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>
    You will get 50 points for submitting a working solution.
</p>
<p>
    The length of your code will be counted in number of ASCII characters.
    Furthermore, for each language, points will be assigned as follows:
    <br>
    - Shortest code - 100 points<br>
    - 2nd shortest code - 83 points<br>
    - 3rd shortest code - 67 points<br>
    You can only get points for one language, and the language in which you scored 
    the highest will give you points. This means that you can deny teams points by
    scoring well in multiple languages.
