    <h1>Bowling Balls</h1>
    <p>
        Bob has a special research project.
        He's trying to analyze how bowling balls bounce and collide.
        Recently, he set up a whole bunch of bowling balls in a large room
        and started them rolling.
    </p>
    <p>
        At first, Bob was watching and noting all the collisions by hand.
        Each collision made a big loud satisfying
        <b><a href="https://youtu.be/51IFubnEAsU?t=32">TOC</a></b>.
        But the balls just kept on rolling and colliding and
        <b>TOC</b>ing, and Bob got more and more tired.
        Finally, Bob had enough, and set up an automated system.
    </p>
    <p>
        He put a sensor in the center of each bowling ball,
        so he could track exactly where each ball was at all times.
        Furthermore, he hooked up a microphone to his computer.
        Every time it heard a <b>TOC</b>, it stored the locations
        of all the bowling balls.
    </p>
    <p>
        Satisfied, Bob went to bed and left his experiment running
        overnight.
        When he woke up, he could still hear the <b>TOC TOC TOC</b>
        of the bowling balls.
        He rushed downstairs to see the balls still rolling and colliding!
        Bob was horrified, because he knew this meant he had generated
        way too much data to analyze by hand.
        He has asked for your help.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given the radius of a bowling ball, and the positions of
        all the balls, recorded as a <b>TOC</b> was heard,
        can you identify which balls are the ones currently colliding?
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line of input will consist of two integers $r$ and $n$,
        denoting the radius of all the bowling balls,
        and the number of bowling balls.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next $n$ lines will each have two real numbers,
        $x_i$ and $y_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$,
        denoting the coordinates of the $i$th bowling ball
        at the instant of the collision.
    </p>
    <p>    
        It is guaranteed that at most two bowling balls are colliding.
        It is guaranteed that the coordinates are accurate
        to an absolute or relative value of $10^-6$.
    </p>
    <p>
        $0 \leq r, n, |x_i|, |y_i| \leq 10^5$
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        If bowling balls $i$ and $j$ are colliding, where $i < j$,
        print $i$ and $j$ on a line, space-seperated.
