    <h1>Climbing Wall</h1>
    <p>
        Bob is starting to learn how to climb!
        Right now, he's at a climbing gym, considering the wall in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
        He climbs by occupying a single handhold, and moving to one within 5 feet of
        his current handhold, repeating over and over.
        His goal is to touch the top of the wall, which he can do from a handhold
        within 5 feet of it.
        He starts at the bottom of the wall, and can reach up to 5 feet up to the first
        handhold.
        Furthermore, Bob is an impatient climber, and will only move to a handhold
        strictly higher on the wall than his current one.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, Bob is also savvy, and wants to find the easiest way up the wall.
        He's assigned a score between 0 and 9 to each handhold, its difficulty.
        Help him find the path that minimizes the sum of the difficulty of handholds!
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line will consist of two integers $h$ and $w$, the height
        and width of the wall in feet. <br>
        The next $h+2$ lines each consist of $w+2$ characters describing the wall.
        Each character consists of a 1 square foot area.<br>
        A number indicates a handhold of that difficulty.<br>
        A dot indicates an area without a handhold.<br>
        Please look at the sample outputs for examples.
    </p>
    <p>
        $1 \leq h \leq 100$<br>
        $1 \leq w \leq 100$
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        Output the minimum sum of handhold difficulties that Bob must take to reach
        the top of the wall.<br>
        If it is impossible to reach the top of the wall, output <code>-1</code>.
    </p>

<p>
    Bob can reach the handholds of difficulty 2 and 4 from the bottom.
    From the handhold 4, he can reach the top of the climbing wall, but he cannot
    from the handhold 2.<br>
    Thus his best path is to move to handhold 4, then reach the top of the wall.
