    <h1>City Planning</h1>
    <p>
        Alice just started her new job as city planner.
    </p>
    <p>
        She is super fond of walkable cities, and wants to make her city as
        walkable as possible.
        However, she knows that she can't just eliminate cars overnight,
        as many businesses would be quite unhappy about that.
        Instead, she's decided to make all of the streets in the city one-way streets.
        This way, she can make the streets narrower, add a bike lane everywhere,
        and widen the sidewalk!
    </p>
    <p>
        The major snag in this plan is that after her changes,
        there should still be at least one way
        to get from anywhere in the city to anywhere else by car.
        Alice is looking hard at the city, but needs your help in figuring out
        if her plan is even possible!
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line of input will consist of two integers $N$ and $M$,
        the number of locations in the city, and the number of streets
        in the city, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next $M$ lines will consist each of two integers $a$ and $b$,
        indicating that there is a street between locations $a$ and $b$.
        It is guaranteed that there is currently at least one way to get from
        every location to every other location.
        There is at most one street connecting any two locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        $1 \leq N \leq 100$, $N-1 \leq M \leq N(N-1)/2$ <br>
        $1 \leq a, b \leq N$
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        If there exists a way of turning all streets into one-way streets such
        that every location can be reached from every location, print <code>YES</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Otherwise, print <code>NO</code>.
    </p>
<h3>Sample Input 1</h3>
<pre>
2 1
1 2
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output 1</h3>
<pre>
NO
</pre>
<p>
    If the street were directed from 1 to 2, there would be no way from 2 to 1.
    Likewise if the street were directed from 2 to 1.
</p>
<h3>Sample Input 2</h3>
<pre>
3 3
3 1
2 1
3 2
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output 2</h3>
<pre>
YES
</pre>
<p>
    The streets can be directed <code>3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3</code>.
