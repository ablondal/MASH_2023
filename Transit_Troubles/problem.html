    <h1>Transit Troubles</h1>
    <p>
        Bob is taking transit to university.
        Bob’s route starts with a walk to the first bus.
        Next, Bob takes a sequence of N buses, where the $(i + 1)$th bus starts where the $i$th bus ends.
        Lastly, Bob must walk from the last bus to his class at university.
        Bob has calculus at 8:30am and wants to wait as long as possible before he leaves.
        Help Bob find the latest time he can leave such that he arrives at university the same time he would’ve if he left now ($t=0$).
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line contains three integers $N$, $w_1$, $w_2$, where $N$ is the number of buses Bob needs to take, $w_1$ is the time it takes to walk from Bob’s home to the first bus, and $w_2$ is the time it takes to walk from the last bus to the university.
        The next $N$ lines contain two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$.
        The $i$th bus comes every $a_i$ minutes starting from $t$=0, and $b_i$ is the length of the $i$th bus ride (in minutes).
        You can assume that these are extremely consistent buses that follow their schedule exactly.
        If Bob arrives at a bus station at time $t$ and his next bus leaves at time $t$, assume the bus driver lets Bob onto the bus before leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
        $1 \leq N \leq 1e5$ <br>
        $1 \leq w_1, w_2, a_i, b_i \leq 1000$ <br>
        All inputs are integers.
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        A single integer $t$, the latest time that Bob can leave such that he will arrive at the same time as he would have if he left at $t$=0.

<p>If Bob leaves at $t$=0, he will arrive at $t$=26. (Bob arrives at the first bus stop at $t$=1, gets on the bus at $t$=10, gets off the bus at $t$=25 and arrives at university at $t$=26). <br>
    The lastest Bob can leave and still arrive at $t$=26 is $t$=9.</p>
