    <h1>Soldier Game</h1>
    <p>
        Alice and Bob are playing a game.
        They have a $1 \times 32$ board in front of them,
        with toy soldiers on some of the squares.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rules of the game are simple:
        Players take turns removing one of the soldiers.
        The key is that a soldier can only be removed if there is a soldier
        in one of its neighbouring squares.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a player cannot make any moves, they lose.
        Bob goes first.
        Assuming that both players play optimally, who wins?
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The input will consist of a string of 32 characters, representing the board.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <code>!</code> represents a square with a soldier, and a <code>.</code>
        is a square without a soldier.
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        <code>Bob</code> if Bob wins.<br>
        <code>Alice</code> if Alice wins.
    </p>
