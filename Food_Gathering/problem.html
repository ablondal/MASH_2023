    <h1>Food Gathering</h1>
    <p>
        Today, Bob and Alice are ants.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alice is the queen, and her colony consists of $n$ chambers and $n-1$ tunnels
        between the chambers.
        Her colony is special: there is exactly one way to use tunnels to get
        between any two chambers in the colony.
    </p>
    <p>
        Workers have been busy all day collecting food and putting it into
        $k$ various chambers around the colony.
        Alice has now assigned Bob a job:
        collect all the food spread around the colony and bring it to Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alice and Bob both start in chamber 1, the royal chamber.
        Bob is very strong and can carry as much food as needs to.
        Calculate the minimum distance Bob will have to walk to gather all
        the food and bring it back to Alice in chamber 1.
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line of input will consist of integers $n$ and $k$,
        the number of chambers in the colony, and the number of chambers with
        food.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following are $n-1$ lines with integers $a_i, b_i, d_i$, indicating that
        there is a tunnel between chambers $a_i$ and $b_i$ with length $d_i$.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, there is a line with $k$ integers $f_1, f_2, \dots, f_k$.
        These indicate the chambers with food in them.
    </p>
    <p>
        $1 \leq k \leq n \leq 1000$
    </p>
    <p>
        $1 \leq a_i, b_i, f_i \leq n$
    </p>
    <p>
        $1 \leq d_i \leq 10^5$
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        Output the minimum distance Bob will have to walk to gather all
        the food and bring it to Alice.

One way for Bob to retrieve the food optimally is to walk to chamber $2$, then $3$,
pick up the food there, return to $2$ then $1$, then walk to chamber $4$ and pick up
that food, then return to $1$ and drop it off.
