    <h1>Prime Tiling</h1>
    <p>
        After saving for 30 years, Bob was finally able to buy a new house in the Vancouver area, and now wants to re-tile the floor.
        The area that Bob wants to re-tile is rectangle shaped, $N$ metres by $M$ metres.
        Unfortunately, the only tiles that Bob can buy from the store are rectangular tiles with dimensions of $1 \times P$ metres, where $P$ is a prime number.
        Bob loves a neat floor and wants all of the tiles he uses to have the same size.
        He also does not want to cut any tiles.
        For a given $N$, $M$ and $P$, help Bob determine if it is possible to tile his $N \times M$ floor with $1 \times P$ tiles such that there are no overlapping tiles and the floor is completely covered.
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        A single line containing three integers $N$, $M$ and $P$.
    </p>
    <p>
        $1 \leq N, M \leq 1000$ <br>
        $2 \leq P \leq 100$, $P$ is guaranteed to be a prime number. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        <code>YES</code> if it is possible for Bob to tile his $N \times M$ floor using only tiles of dimension $1 \times P$. <br>
        <code>NO</code> if it is not possible.
