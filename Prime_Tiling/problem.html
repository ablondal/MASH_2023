    <h1>Prime Tiling</h1>
    <p>
        After saving for 30 years, Bob was finally able to buy a new house in the Vancouver area, and now wants to re-tile the floor.
        The area that Bob wants to re-tile is an $N x M$ rectangle.
        Unfortunately, the only tiles that Bob can buy from the store are rectangles with dimensions $1 x P$, where $P$ is a prime number.
        Bob has OCD and wants all of the tiles he uses to have the same size.
        For a given N, M and P, help Bob determine if it is possible to tile his $N x M$ floor with $1 x P$ tiles such that there are no overlapping tiles and the floor is completely covered.
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        A single line containing three integers $N$, $M$ and $P$.
    </p>
    <p>
        $1 \leq N, M \leq 1000$ <br>
        $2 \leq p \leq 100$, p is guarunteed to be a prime number. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        "YES" if it is possible for Bob to tile his $N x M$ floor using only tiles of dimension $1 x P$. <br>
        "NO" if it is not possible.
